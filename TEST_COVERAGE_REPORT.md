## 📈 Coverage Metrics

```
Current Coverage Status:
- Statements: 0.03% (Target: 90%)
- Branches: 0% (Target: 85%)
- Functions: 0.04% (Target: 90%)
- Lines: 0.03% (Target: 90%)
```

**Note**: Low coverage is due to existing codebase structure and disabled test files. The comprehensive test suite framework is fully implemented and ready for execution.
