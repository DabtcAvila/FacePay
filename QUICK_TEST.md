## DEPLOYMENT DIAGNOSTIC INFO
**Based on code analysis and remote testing:**

### Available Routes (confirmed in code):
- `/` - Homepage (main landing page)
- `/demo` - Demo page (exists in code but returns 404)
- `/auth` - Authentication page
- `/dashboard` - User dashboard
- `/biometric` - Biometric setup
- `/test-biometric` - Biometric testing
- `/webauthn-test` - WebAuthn testing
- `/payments` - Payment processing
- `/admin/*` - Admin panel routes
- `/api/health` - Health check (exists in code but returns 404)

### Potential Issues:

2. **Environment Variables**: May be missing required ENV vars
3. **Database Connection**: Health check suggests database dependency
4. **Static Generation**: May have build-time issues

### Manual Testing Required:
- Test in actual browser at https://facepay.vercel.app
- Check browser console for errors
- Test biometric functionality on compatible devices
- Verify payment flow integration
