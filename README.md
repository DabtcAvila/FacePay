# FacePay - Biometric Payment Platform

A next-generation payment platform that combines facial recognition, WebAuthn biometric authentication, and blockchain technology to provide the most secure and seamless payment experience possible.

## Features

### 🔐 Multi-Modal Biometric Authentication
- **Facial Recognition**: Advanced AI-powered facial recognition for secure user identification
- **WebAuthn Support**: Passwordless authentication using device biometrics (fingerprint, Face ID, etc.)
- **Multi-Factor Security**: Combine multiple biometric factors for enhanced security

### 💳 Payment Integration
- **Stripe Integration**: Traditional payment processing with cards and bank accounts
- **Blockchain Support**: Ethereum and Web3 wallet integration
- **Multi-Currency**: Support for fiat and cryptocurrency transactions

### 🛡️ Security First
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All biometric data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Biometric templates never leave the device
- **PCI DSS Compliant**: Enterprise-grade payment security standards

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with encrypted biometric data storage
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with WebAuthn integration
- **Payments**: Stripe SDK, Ethers.js for blockchain
- **Biometrics**: SimpleWebAuthn, custom facial recognition APIs
